# Description

- In this coding challenge I developed a simple web-app using public transport API and (vbb-stations-autocomplete, vbb-stations) libraries to auto-complete the name of stops.Unfortunately,I did not do the design phase which is an important stage whenbuilding a web app nub I used my imagination and inspiration from DBnavigator application.

- The main idea of this web-app is to display all departures from a specific start point (stop/station), to do that I decided to start by search form that includes 3 inputs. The first is for searching for a desired stop, the second is for choosing o stop from the favorite list and last one is a radio button.

- The next page is for showing departures. I put the needed information inside a Grid displaying the plannedDeparture and expected Departure(planned + delay) to give the user real time data. The last page contains a timeline of all stopovers in the selected trip to give the user an overview on the length and the number of stops to reach the destination. 

### `server -s build`
The web-app is ready to be run on production mode and to be deployed.
